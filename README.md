Description of the main learning objectives for this project
I would say that the main learning objectives for this project were just going more in depth with what we did in the local library tutorial.

Description of challenges that you ran into and the process of how you worked through the issues.
The big problems I ran into were at the end. It wasn't letting me connect my database, but I was able to get that fixed.

Reflection on how you see this tutorial helping you approach future web projects.
This project got me more comfortable with the basics of creating a database on mlab.
